# Project FOOLERY

## Introduction

Services such as Kayak, Orbitz, and Travelocity abound in the digital ether, delivering vacation and travel fares to consumers worldwide. As we look for services that translate from travel to physical household products, our search has come up shy. The consumer goods industry is flooded with services like Amazon and Wish which bring goods, both necessary and unnecessary, to your door, there are still consumers out there that can’t wait until the next day to have the product they need in hand. While businesses such as Consumer Reports can give you ratings on merchandise that is similar, scouring the internet for review sources on a product can be time consuming and laborious.

## Vision

Project FOOLERY is focused on giving the consumer crowdsourced ratings on products they need, and the ability to find the cheapest brick and mortar store closest to them where they can make their purchase. The goal of project FOOLERY is to allow consumers to avoid long shipping and handling wait times by providing them with the nearest location for them to purchase the goods they are looking for. We also aim to make the consumer buying process easier by sourcing reviews for the consumer to peruse.

## Scope

This application will utilize geographical and localized data to display brick and mortar retail locations that should have the product in stock. Project FOOLERY will also utilize automated systems to scrape reviews and pricing information for a wide variety of household goods. Users will be able to allow location data from their device to be used, or be able to type in their zip code in order to narrow down the list of retailers that carry the product they are attempting to find.

## Business rules and value

Project FOOLERY is open to every user but only subscribed user will have access to discounts or coupons provided by businesses that register with Project FOOLERY. The business value for this rule will increase users and user subscription.

Businesses that sign up with the project will be allowed to advertise their products within the application by promoting listings. This will increase the number of businesses that are willing to register because they will have many guests and subscribed users that they can target listings at.

Users of the application will have an option to pay for merchandise within the app and store receipts in their account. The application will use this business rule to collect user data and sell it to businesses that advertise within the application, with the caveat of user opt out.

This project will also define limitations based on local regulations. It protects user’s personal information, financial cost, preliminary project schedule. It defines solution based on requirement and analysis decision.

## Feasibility Studies

After conducting initial searches online, we have concluded that the need for an app such as Project FOOLERY is needed by the consumer goods industry.

Platforming will be done initially through a web-based application, with the potential to expand to a mobile application. This potential will be based on a data collection of visitor device usage.

More research will be needed to determine whether or not open APIs are available for sourcing products, reviews and locations.

## Software Development Methodology

Choosing the right software development process is very essential. This project will follow an agile software development methodology because the agile development process requires breaking down each project into sprints and delivering each sprint within an iterative cycle. We plan to follow 2-week iterations. Following a 2-week iteration cycle we hope to be able to use at most 3-4 days for research and the rest of the time for development.

Research days will include gathering user feedback about the product, this will allow us to make the necessary adjustments for the preparation day. This cycle allows key stakeholders to participate in the project and we will be able to make objective changes without spending more time than necessary in development.

## Proposed system functionalities

The main function of the application is to provide users with the cheapest available prices of home and consumer goods based on their current location.

Users of the system are defined as guest users, subscribed users, businesses and application systems. Potential use cases of the systems are described in the table below.
